INTRODUCTION
In trying to understand online customer behaviour I was tasked with analysing the data from 2 different companies i.e a Kenyan business and a Russian business by the name of Kira Plastinina. I have applied supervised learning models on the Kenyan business' data to try and understand what would drive a customer to click on an ad on its website. I have also applied unsupervised learning models on the Russian business in order to draw insights from the dataset.


APPROACH
To draw insights from the Kenyan business data as to what drives customers to click on ads on its website I implemented:
a.)Univariate and Bivariate analaysis
b.)Multiple linear regression
c.)Decision trees

To draw insights from the Russian dataset as to what drives customer behaviour I implemented:
a.)K-Means clustering
b.)Hierarchical clustering
c.)DBSCAN clustering


DATASETS
The following datasets were provided:
a.) The Kenyan business: http://bit.ly/IPAdvertisingData

TECHNOLOGIES/LANGUAGES USED
a.) IDE - I used Rstudio version 2022.02.3+492
